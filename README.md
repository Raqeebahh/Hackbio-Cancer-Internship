## Welcome to the HackBio Cancer Internship repository. 

This repository contains code, datasets, and documentation generated during the bioinformatics internship program, focusing on the intersection of oncology and bioinformatics.

As a member of the Biomarker Discovery Track, my work primarily involves identifying genomic and molecular markers that can serve as potential biomarkers for cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy. In addition, I collaborate with other specialized tracks focused on Machine Learning, Drug Development, Frontend Bioinformatics and Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) in Cancer, contributing to a comprehensive approach to cancer research.

Our collective efforts aim to uncover critical insights into cancer biology, using diverse bioinformatics methods and techniques.
