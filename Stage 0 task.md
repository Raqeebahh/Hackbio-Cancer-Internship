**Central Dogma of Molecular Biology: Introduction**

The central dogma of molecular biology, first articulated by Francis Crick in 1958, is a theory stating that genetic information flows only in one direction, from DNA, to RNA, to protein, or RNA directly to protein.

**Central Dogma of Molecular Biology as a concept of Biomarker Discovery in Cancer**

Biomarkers, defined as measurable indicators of biological processes, are critical for early diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic decisions in oncology (Strimbu & Tavel, 2010). By elucidating the molecular changes that drive cancer, the central dogma guides the identification of DNA, RNA, and protein-based biomarkers

**DNA Biomarkers in Cancer**

Mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes are key DNA biomarkers derived from the central dogma. For instance, mutations in the TP53 gene, which encodes the p53 protein, are prevalent in many cancers, including breast and lung cancers. These mutations disrupt the geneâ€™s normal function in DNA repair and apoptosis, leading to uncontrolled cell growth (Soussi & Wiman, 2015). The detection of TP53 mutations in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) serves as a non-invasive biomarker for cancer diagnosis and monitoring disease progression.

**RNA Biomarkers: The Role of Transcriptomics**

RNA biomarkers, particularly mRNA and non-coding RNA, are critical in cancer biomarker discovery. Transcriptomic studies reveal that differential mRNA expression can distinguish cancerous tissues from normal tissues. For example, the overexpression of ERBB2 (HER2) mRNA is a well-established biomarker in breast cancer, guiding the use of targeted therapies such as trastuzumab (Moasser, 2007). Additionally, microRNAs (miRNAs), small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression, have been identified as biomarkers. miR-21, for example, is often upregulated in various cancers and is associated with poor prognosis, highlighting its potential as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker (Volinia et al., 2006).

**Protein Biomarkers: The End Product of the Central Dogma**

Proteins, as the end products of gene expression, are crucial for functional studies in cancer. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a classic example of a protein biomarker widely used for prostate cancer screening. Advances in proteomics have identified numerous cancer-associated proteins, such as CA-125 for ovarian cancer and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) for colorectal cancer, aiding in early detection and treatment monitoring (Henry & Hayes, 2012).

**Conclusion**

The central dogma of molecular biology provides a framework for understanding the molecular basis of cancer and discovering novel biomarkers. By tracing the path from DNA mutations to aberrant protein function, researchers can identify critical targets for cancer diagnosis and therapy, ultimately improving patient outcomes.
